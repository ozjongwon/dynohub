# Dynohub, a Clojure DynamoDB client

Dynohub was forked from Peter Taoussanis' [Faraday](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/faraday).

The most of internal details are same between Dynohub and Faraday, except:
  * Experimental to learn low level Clojure programming
  * Further abstraction layers (dynolite)

Most parts of Faraday documentation can be served as Dynohub documentation.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

Add the necessary dependency to your [Leiningen][] `project.clj` and `require` the library in your ns:

```clojure
[com.ozjongwon/dynohub "0.0.1"] ; project.clj
(ns my-app (:require [ozjongwon.dynohub :as dh])) ; ns
```
